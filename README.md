# SOAR-EDR

## Objective
  This project objective is focused on learning how to reduce repetetive tasks while following structured process using platforms like Tines and LimaCharlie. Throughout this home lab, I've learned how to configure an automated playbook that sends alerts via email and Slack. This also involves implementation of responsive capability that allows an analyst to automatically isolate a compromised machine with a single click. This project helped me learn the logic of security orchestration that demonstrates practical SOC automation skills.
